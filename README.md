# Personal-Income-Classification-for-Subsidy

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify income levels using a dataset of 32,000 individuals with demographic, financial parameters. The model simplifies data analysis and supports effective subsidy allocation by minimizing complexity and ensuring reliable predictions. Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest algorithms were implemented to develop and compare the classification models.
